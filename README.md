The Calculator App using Jetpack Compose is a simple yet powerful calculator application built using Jetpack Compose, a modern UI toolkit for Android. This app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In this essay, we will delve into the architecture, user interface, state management, logic, and features of this app.

**Architecture**
The app consists of a single activity, MainActivity, which sets the content view to the App composable function. The App function is the entry point of the app and contains the calculator UI. This architecture is straightforward and easy to maintain, making it an ideal choice for a simple calculator app.
User Interface
The calculator UI is composed of several components, each playing a crucial role in the overall user experience. The CalcView is the top-level composable function that contains the calculator UI. It is divided into several rows, each containing numeric buttons, operation buttons, and an equals button. The CalcDisplay function displays the current calculation result, while the CalcRow function represents a row of numeric buttons. The CalcNumericButton, CalcOperationButton, and CalcEqualsButton functions represent individual numeric buttons, operation buttons, and the equals button, respectively.

**State Management**
The app uses Jetpack Compose's rememberSaveable API to store the calculator's state, including the left and right operands, the operation, and the completion status. This approach ensures that the app's state is preserved even when the user navigates away from the app or restarts the device.

**Logic**
The app's logic is implemented in the CalcView composable function. It handles various scenarios, including when the user presses a numeric button, an operation button, or the equals button. When a numeric button is pressed, the app updates the left or right operand depending on the current state. When an operation button is pressed, the app updates the operation and sets the completion status to false. When the equals button is pressed, the app performs the calculation and updates the display text. Finally, when a numeric button is pressed after the equals button, the app resets the calculator state.

**Features**
The app supports several features, including basic arithmetic operations, support for multiple-digit numbers, and display of the current calculation result. These features make the app a convenient tool for users who need to perform simple calculations on the go.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Calculator App using Jetpack Compose is a well-designed and easy-to-use calculator application that provides a seamless user experience. Its architecture, user interface, state management, logic, and features all work together to create a powerful tool that is both functional and intuitive. Whether you are a developer looking to learn from this app's design or a user looking for a reliable calculator app, this app is definitely worth exploring.
